# StayHealthy Go Digital Initiative: Patient-Doctor Connection Platform

Welcome to StayHealthy Go Digital Initiative, a project by StayHealthy Inc., aiming to bridge the gap between patients and doctors in remote areas. This README.md file provides an overview of the project, its requirements, features, and the expectations from you as a front-end developer.

## Project Overview

StayHealthy Inc. is dedicated to improving healthcare facilities in remote areas with limited access to medical resources. The Go digital initiative focuses on building a user-friendly website to connect patients with doctors and specialists for consultations and medical prescriptions.

## Problem Statement

In remote areas, patients often struggle to find the right doctor at the right time, leading to life-threatening emergencies or lost lives. This platform aims to solve this problem by enabling online medical appointments and consultations.

## Project Requirements

- **Medical Appointments Online:** Schedule appointments with doctors anytime, anywhere.
- **Doctor Listing for Patients:** View available doctors, their ratings, and search by name.
- **Consultation Feedback:** Rate consultations to help others make informed choices.
- **Profile Management:** Users must sign up, provide mandatory details, and manage their profiles.
- **Access to Patient Records:** Patients can access and download their medical records.
- **News Feeds and Training:** Educational videos and daily tips on various health topics.
- **Navigation:** Intuitive navigation with minimal clicks.
- **Website Administration:** Admin capabilities to manage patient and doctor profiles, generate reports, and maintain system security.

## Development Phases

The project will be developed in phases. In the first phase, the focus is on:

- Designing UI/UX using Figma
- Developing static and responsive pages with HTML, CSS, and Reactjs
- Deploying the website

## Application Development Lifecycle

Follow the application development lifecycle provided in the documentation. Thoroughly analyze the requirements before moving to the next phase.

## Expectations from You

For the first phase, your responsibilities include:

- Designing UI/UX using Figma
- Developing static and responsive pages with HTML, CSS, and Reactjs
- Deploying the website

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
